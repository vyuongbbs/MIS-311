# Project : Cost of Living Analysis
# Project overview
# Objective 
The objective of this project is to analyze global trends in cost of living and average monthly income across multiple countries and regions. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to understand the relationship between the income level of individuals and the expenses required to maintain living standards in different parts of the world. Through data visualization and statistical interpretation, this project highlights economic differences between regions, identifies patterns of affordability, and provides insights that may assist individuals, policymakers, and businesses in making informed decisions regarding relocation, salary benchmarking, and international market evaluation.
